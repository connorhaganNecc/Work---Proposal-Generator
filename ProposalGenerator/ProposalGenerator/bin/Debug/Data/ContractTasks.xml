      <HeadLevelItem>CONCEPT PLAN</HeadLevelItem>
      <Description>MCG will prepare two (2) subdivision plans.  The first plan will illustrate a subdivision in full compliance with applicable zoning and subdivision regulations.  The “by-right” concept will illustrate the maximum development potential of the site taking into consideration soil information, wetlands and applicable zoning constraints.  The second concept plan will incorporate waivers under the subdivision regulations to minimize the development footprint.  Anticipated waivers may include but not be limited to roadway width, right of way width, sidewalks, curbing, stormwater management (country drainage) and reduced cul-de-sac diameter and off-centerline alignment.  Once the client approves the 2 concept plans, they will be updated to presentation quality format in color for use in informal meetings with the Conservation Commission and Planning Board.</Description>

          <text>MCG will prepare a Drainage Calculations and Stormwater Management Plan in accordance with the Malden Ordinances and generally following the Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP’s) Stormwater Management Regulations (SMR) as revised Jan. 2, 2008 as a guideline.  Scope includes design of drainage infrastructure to ensure no adverse impacts to the municipal drain system.  This is generally anticipated to be water quality calculations, pipe sizing calculations and the like.  We anticipate a reduction in impervious area therefore calculations for mitigation of post-development rates of runoff will not be necessary.  The report will include a Best Management Practices (BMP) Post-Development Operation and Construction Phase Maintenance Plan.  It is assumed that catch basins will be installed in the existing parking area to remain and connected to the municipal drain system as is a customary, minimum improvement to stormwater quality and surface flow mitigation to the roadway.</text>
