      <Header>Amend Order of Conditions</Header>
      <Body>We shall prepare a request to the Conservation Commission to amend the existing Order of Conditions.  This request shall be submitted to the Conservation Commission and abutters will be notified of the hearing by certified mail/return receipt requested.
&lt;FEE&gt;The fee for this service is $425.00&lt;/FEE&gt;
Our fee does not include the filing fee, cost of the legal ad to be published in the local newspaper or the cost of postage to notify abutters; all of which will be reflected on your bill as an out of pocket expense.
We shall present the project at two regularly scheduled Conservation Commission public hearings.
&lt;FEE&gt;The fee for this service is $400.00&lt;/FEE&gt;
&lt;NOTE&gt;Any meeting or site visit time over 2 hours will be charged at a rate of $125/hour, and any additional public hearings will be $200 (minimum).&lt;/NOTE&gt;</Body>

      <Body>Our surveyors shall visit the site to locate any existing monuments in the neighborhood.  The plan we have of your lot does not show existing monuments.  Our additional research should uncover more monuments.  Finding monuments in the field that agree with plans of record is difficult, but necessary so that we can stake your lot lines.  If no monuments are found or if monuments are found and don’t agree with record plans we will inform you.   
&lt;FEE&gt;&lt;/FEE&gt;
If the location exceeds 4 hours we shall charge you at a rate of $125/hour thereafter.</Body>

      <Header>Notice of Intent</Header>
      <Body>Our office shall prepare a Notice of Intent describing the work proposed within the buffer zone of the bordering vegetated wetlands.  This application will be filed with the Conservation Commission, abutters will be notified of the hearing by &lt;BOLD&gt;certified mail/return receipt requested OR CERTIFICATE OF MAILING (depends on the Town)&lt;/BOLD&gt;, we shall attend the public hearings (estimate of 2 hearings) and we shall conduct one site visit as scheduled by the Commission.
&lt;FEE&gt;&lt;/FEE&gt;
Our fee breakdown is as follows:
&lt;DTAB&gt;Notice of Intent…………………………………….………….$725.00&lt;/DTAB&gt;
&lt;DTAB&gt;Two public hearings $200 (minimum) /each……$400.00&lt;/DTAB&gt;
&lt;DTAB&gt;Site visit……………………………………………………...…….$200.00 (minimum)&lt;/DTAB&gt;
&lt;BLANK&gt;
&lt;NOTE&gt;Any meeting or site visit time over 2 hours will be charged at a rate of $125/hour.&lt;/NOTE&gt;
&lt;BLANK&gt;
Our fee &lt;UNDER&gt;does not&lt;/UNDER&gt; include the filing fee, cost of the legal ad to be published in the local newspaper or the cost of the postage to notify abutters; all which will be reflected on your bill as an out of pocket expense.
&lt;BLANK&gt;
Please be aware that it is routine that during the public hearing process comments made by Commission members and/or abutters may cause revisions to the design plans which do not substantially affect the intent of the design. If revisions are required that result in additional charges we will review same with you prior to revising the plan. These revisions would be reflected as an extra on your invoice.
&lt;BLANK&gt;
Once the hearing is closed and the project is approved, the Commission will issue an Order of Conditions.  Once all of the site improvement work is completed, a request for a Certificate of Compliance (CoC) from the Commission is required.  While we cannot anticipate the full scope of the CoC at this time, since this has to be negotiated with the Commission during the permitting process, it should be noted that typically this process requires an as-built survey plan, engineering certificate, application, a meeting and a site walk.  Upon completion of the project, we can provide you with an estimate for this work.

      <Header>Notifying Abutters</Header>
      <Body>While we are performing our survey it is customary to enter abutting land to locate existing monuments.  If this is necessary, we will knock on your abutters door to ask permission to enter their land.  If a neighbor informs us that they do not want us on their land we will then officially notify them, by certified mail, in accordance with the “Trespass Law” MGL Chapter 266, §120C.  If this is necessary, there will be an extra charge of $200 (this fee is not included in this proposal).

      <Header>Septic As-Built Plan</Header>
      <Body>Upon the installation of the septic system, but prior to backfilling we shall conduct an inspection and prepare a Septic System As-built Plan pursuant to the Board of Health Regulations.
&lt;FEE&gt;&lt;/FEE&gt;
&lt;BOLD&gt;Please contact our office 1 week prior to the installation of the system so that we may schedule our field crew for you.&lt;/BOLD&gt;
&lt;BLANK&gt;
From time to time septic installers do not install the system in accordance with our plans and we must return to the site after our instructed changes are made.  This prompts an additional charge to you which we recommend you pass on to your installer if this event occurs.
&lt;BLANK&gt;
The following 2 as-built services may be required by the Town Health Agent during the installation of your system and prior to the Town’s final approval:
&lt;BLANK&gt;
&lt;NUMLIST&gt;
At times the Board of Health requires that an inspection be performed when your leaching area is excavated.  If such an inspection is required an additional $135 will be charged for this service.
If your system requires a pump chamber, the pumps and pump chamber have to be tested with the Health Agent present at a separate time.  An additional cost of $135 will be charged.

      <Header>Soil Testing</Header>
      <Body>We shall conduct percolation tests and deep hole observation test pits, in the presence of the Health Agent.  We shall complete the soil testing application and will ask that you provide the $%TOWNFEE% Town filing fee.  Prior to soil testing, the site shall be pre-marked for Dig Safe, and a trench permit will be obtained by the backhoe operator.
&lt;FEE&gt;&lt;/FEE&gt;
This fee is based on 4 hours of the soil evaluator’s time.  If more time is needed due to slower soils being present or the necessity to return to the site at a later date a fee of $100/hour for the soil evaluator will be charged thereafter.
&lt;BLANK&gt;
 A backhoe is needed to conduct these tests.  We shall hire a backhoe and will ask that their office bill you directly for their work.  The backhoe operator will rough grade the area of the yard that was disturbed for test holes, but no grass seed will be put down.
&lt;BLANK&gt;
 During the time we do the soil testing we will evaluate any wetlands which may impact our design.  We will provide you with a separate proposal for this work if filing with the Conservation Commission is required.
&lt;BLANK&gt;
Once the soil testing is completed we will prepare a preliminary design of your system.   At this time we will assess if any local waivers to the Board of Health Regulations or variances from Title 5 are needed.  We will make that assessment and will provide you with a separate proposal for this work, if required.</Body>

      <Body>Once the topographic information is compiled in our office we shall prepare the replacement Sanitary Disposal System Design in accordance with the local Board of Health Regulations and the State Environmental Code, Title 5.
&lt;FEE&gt;&lt;/FEE&gt;
&lt;BULLET&gt;
At times a sieve analysis (conducted by a certified lab) is used in lieu of a percolation test due to saturated soil conditions on site.  If it is determined that a sieve analysis is required, then an additional $150/soil sample will be charged.  Generally 1-2 soil samples are required. 
If an alternative technology component is required as part of the system design we shall contact you prior to the commencement of any design work and will inform you of expected additional costs which would be shown as “extras” on your invoices.
If your installer requires us to layout the location of the septic system, prior to installation, an additional $330 will be charged.
At times sanitary disposal systems involve pumping to the leaching facility.  If your system requires a pump an additional $250 will be charged.
&lt;/BULLET&gt;
Once this plan is complete we shall file an application with the Board of Health.  A filing fee of $%TOWNFEE% made payable to the Town is due upon submission of this application.</Body>
